# Dependencies

[![Build Status](http://ci.cartalyst.com/build-status/svg/12)](http://ci.cartalyst.com/build-status/view/12)

Our dependencies package is a simple package which allows you to sort dependencies, be it assets, simple strings, or class instances. It's clever enough to avoid circular dependencies in a never-ending loop.

Part of the Cartalyst Arsenal & licensed [Cartalyst PSL](LICENSE). Code well, rock on.
