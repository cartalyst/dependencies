## Introduction

The dependencies package is a simple package which allows you to sort dependencies, be it assets, simple strings, or class instances. It's clever enough to avoid circular dependencies in a never-ending loop.

The package requires PHP 7.2+ and follows the FIG standard PSR-0 to ensure a high level of interoperability between shared PHP code and is unit-tested.
